2. Disconnect from the Internet: Malware often communicates with its servers over the internet, so it's important to disconnect the infected computer from the internet to prevent further spread of the malware and to minimize the risk of data loss.
3. Boot into Safe Mode: Restart the computer and boot into Safe Mode. This will load the operating system with only the essential drivers and services, making it easier to identify and remove the malware.
4. Use Antivirus Software: Run a full system scan using reputable antivirus or anti-malware software. Make sure the software is up to date and has the latest virus definitions. Allow the software to quarantine or remove any detected malware.
5. Use Malware Removal Tools: In addition to antivirus software, consider using specialized malware removal tools such as Malwarebytes or AdwCleaner to thoroughly scan and remove any remaining traces of malware.
6. Check System Files: After removing the malware, it's a good idea to check the integrity of system files using the built-in Windows System File Checker (sfc /scannow command in Command Prompt) to ensure that the operating system is not corrupted.
7. Update Operating System and Software: Once the malware is removed, ensure that the operating system and all installed software are up to date with the latest security patches and updates to prevent future infections.
8. Reconnect to the Internet: After confirming that the malware has been successfully removed, reconnect the computer to the internet and monitor for any unusual behavior or signs of re-infection.
9. Restore Backed-Up Files: Finally, restore the backed-up important files from the external storage or cloud storage to their original locations on the computer.
By following these steps, your friend can effectively remove malware from their computer while safeguarding their important files and ensuring their privacy.
