This key is usually displayed on the screen during startup and can vary depending on the laptop's manufacturer (common keys include F2, F10, or Del).\n\nStep 2: Access the BIOS or UEFI Settings\nOnce your friend has entered the BIOS or UEFI settings, they should look for an option to boot from a different device, such as a USB drive. They may need to navigate through the settings using the arrow keys and Enter key.\n\nStep 3: Create a Password Reset Disk\nIf your friend has a spare USB drive, they can use it to create a password reset disk. They can do this by accessing the \"Security\" or \"Boot\" section of the BIOS or UEFI settings and selecting the USB drive as the primary boot device. Then, they should save the changes and exit the BIOS or UEFI settings.\n\nStep 4: Use the Password Reset Disk\nNext, your friend can insert the password reset disk into the USB port and restart the laptop. The laptop should now boot from the USB drive instead of the internal hard drive.\n\nStep 5: Reset the Password\nOnce the laptop has booted from the USB drive, your friend can follow the on-screen instructions to reset the password. This may involve using a password reset tool or accessing the command prompt to change the password.\n\nStep 6: Restart the Laptop\nAfter the password has been reset, your friend can remove the USB drive and restart the laptop. They should now be able to log in using the new password and access their important documents.\n\nIt's important to note that this process may vary slightly depending on the specific make and model of the laptop, as well as the operating system it is running.
