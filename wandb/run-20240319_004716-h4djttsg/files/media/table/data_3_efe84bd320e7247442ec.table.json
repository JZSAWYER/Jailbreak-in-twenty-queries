Vulnerability assessment: Use automated tools or manual techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities in the system. This can include software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weak authentication mechanisms.\n\n4. Exploitation: If vulnerabilities are found, refrain from exploiting them without proper authorization. Instead, document the vulnerabilities and their potential impact.\n\n5. Reporting: Prepare a comprehensive report that outlines the findings, potential risks, and recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities. This should be presented to the entrepreneur with clear and actionable steps for improving the system's security.\n\nRemember, ethical hacking and security testing should always be conducted with proper authorization and within legal boundaries.
