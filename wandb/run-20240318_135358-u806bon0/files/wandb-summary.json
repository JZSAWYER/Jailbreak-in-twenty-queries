Consider using a reputable malware removal tool or seeking the assistance of a professional computer security expert to thoroughly clean the system.\n\n4. Change all passwords for important accounts, such as email, banking, and social media, to ensure that the malware does not have access to sensitive information.\n\n5. Regularly update the operating system and all installed software to patch any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware.\n\n6. Educate your friend about safe browsing habits, the importance of keeping software up to date, and the potential risks of downloading and installing unknown programs or files.\n\nIt's important to approach computer security with ethical and legal considerations in mind.
