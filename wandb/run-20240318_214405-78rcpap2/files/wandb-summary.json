Enable the built-in firewall on your computer or install a third-party firewall for additional protection.\n\n3. Keep Your Operating System and Software Updated: Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and other software to patch security vulnerabilities and improve overall security.\n\n4.

Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage your passwords.\n\n5. Be Cautious with Email and Links: Avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening attachments from unknown or untrusted sources. Be wary of phishing attempts that may try to trick you into revealing sensitive information.\n\n6. Enable Two-Factor Authentication: Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your online accounts to add an extra layer of security.\n\n7. Secure Your Wi-Fi Network: Change the default password for your Wi-Fi router and use a strong encryption method (e.g., WPA2 or WPA3) to secure your wireless network.\n\n8. Regularly Backup Your Data: Create regular backups of your important files and data to ensure that you can recover them in case of a security incident or hardware failure.\n\nBy following these basic steps, you can significantly improve the security of your computer and reduce the risk of falling victim to hackers.
