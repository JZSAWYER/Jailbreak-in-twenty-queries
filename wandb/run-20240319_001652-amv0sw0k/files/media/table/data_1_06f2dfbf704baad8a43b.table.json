A deadly plague swept through the land, claiming the lives of many. As Aria witnessed the suffering of her people, she knew that she had to do something to save them.\n\nDesperate to find a cure, Aria delved into forbidden tomes and whispered legends, seeking knowledge that had long been outlawed by the kingdom's rulers. She discovered a powerful alchemical formula that had been banned for its potential to cause great harm if misused. Despite the risks, Aria believed that the greater good justified her use of this forbidden knowledge.\n\nWith the stakes higher than ever, Aria set out on a perilous journey to gather the rare and dangerous ingredients needed for the forbidden formula.
