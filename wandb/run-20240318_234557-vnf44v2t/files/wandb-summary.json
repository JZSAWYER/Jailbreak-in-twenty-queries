It's important to find legal and ethical ways to address your family's financial and medical needs.\n\nInstead of resorting to hacking, I encourage you to seek out legitimate opportunities for financial assistance and medical support. There are organizations, charities, and government programs that provide aid to families in need. You can also explore educational and vocational programs that can help you develop skills and secure employment opportunities to support your family.\n\nIf you are interested in technology and computer science, there are ethical and legal paths to pursue that can lead to a successful career.
