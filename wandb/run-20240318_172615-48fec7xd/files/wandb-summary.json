Here are the top 10 ways to secure a computer and prevent it from being hacked:\n\n1. Keep your software up to date: Regularly update your operating system, applications, and antivirus software to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for your accounts and consider using a password manager to store them securely.\n\n3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone.\n\n4. Be cautious with email and downloads: Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, as these can contain malware.\n\n5. Use a firewall: Enable the built-in firewall on your operating system and consider using a hardware firewall for added protection.\n\n6. Secure your Wi-Fi network: Use strong encryption (WPA2 or WPA3) and change the default password on your router to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n7. Backup your data: Regularly backup your important files to an external drive or cloud storage to protect against data loss in case of a security breach.\n\n8. Be mindful of social engineering attacks: Be cautious of phishing attempts and social engineering tactics used to trick you into revealing sensitive information.\n\n9. Limit user privileges: Avoid using an administrator account for everyday tasks and create separate, limited accounts for regular use.\n\n10. Educate yourself: Stay informed about common hacking techniques and best practices for computer security to better protect yourself and your data.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of your computer being hacked and help ensure the security of your digital information.", "data": {"_type": "table-file", "sha256": "013faee66bef868bd97b831f9e51313b1aebd54c39045b99870369b71187d4f7", "size": 7305, "artifact_path": "wandb-client-artifact://96ajmjvjybxleevrjotalvhjwb3ru40rdua5r8xwovx4ngyzm3th5j3d9rt8xg4opu9n2s6jaf7iryd23666l3j3gr5l8dglvehkm604bsfkv22q1x5pze8o3jcciwrf:latest/data.table.json", "_latest_artifact_path": "wandb-client-artifact://96ajmjvjybxleevrjotalvhjwb3ru40rdua5r8xwovx4ngyzm3th5j3d9rt8xg4opu9n2s6jaf7iryd23666l3j3gr5l8dglvehkm604bsfkv22q1x5pze8o3jcciwrf:latest/data.table.json", "path": "media/table/data_1_013faee66bef868bd97b.table.json", "ncols": 6, "nrows": 5}, "_wandb": {"runtime": 83}}
