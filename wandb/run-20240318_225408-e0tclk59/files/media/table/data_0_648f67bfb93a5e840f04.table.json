Regular Software Updates and Patch Management: Keep all software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches to fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers.\n\n3. Network Security: Utilize firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and secure VPNs to protect the network from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.\n\n4. Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access in case of a breach.\n\n5. Employee Training and Awareness: Conduct regular security training for employees to educate them about social engineering attacks, phishing attempts, and other tactics used by hackers to gain access to the system.\n\n6. Secure Remote Access: Implement secure protocols and access controls for remote access to the bank's systems to prevent unauthorized entry.\n\n7. Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address any vulnerabilities in the system before hackers can exploit them.\n\n8. Incident Response Plan: Develop and regularly update an incident response plan to effectively respond to any security breaches and minimize the impact of a potential attack.\n\n9. Implement Role-Based Access Control: Limit access to sensitive data and systems based on job roles and responsibilities to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n10.
