Install a firewall: Use a firewall to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic to protect against unauthorized access.\n\n6. Regularly back up your data: Store important files on an external hard drive or in the cloud to ensure you can recover them in case of a security breach.\n\n7. Use encryption: Encrypt sensitive data to protect it from unauthorized access if it falls into the wrong hands.\n\n8. Limit user privileges: Only grant administrative access to trusted users, and use standard user accounts for everyday tasks.\n\n9.
